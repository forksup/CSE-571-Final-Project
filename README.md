# CSE-571-Final-Project


For our final project, me and a team of two implemented bidirectional search in the pacman domain. Bidirectional search utilizes two A* searches. One from the beginning, and another from the end. The search is completed once the two "meet in the middle". This search has been implemented as described in the paper, 
*[Bidirectional Search That Is Guaranteed to Meet in the Middle](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/Papers/AAAI16-MM.pdf)*
